# RhythmPad

Have you played rhythm games and seen people use those cool keyboards with either just 4 keys, or 3 keys for games like osu!, osu!mania and Geometry Dash? The Rhythm Pad aims to be complatible with many rhythm games!

## Bill of Materials
Keyboard components:
- 5x Cherry MX switches
- 5x Blank DSA keycaps
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x PCB
- 6x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x WS2812B LED

Yes I am aware that this is larger than 200x200x100mm, but hopefully this can be an exception.
