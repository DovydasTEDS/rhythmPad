# RhythmPad

Have you played rhythm games and seen people use those cool keyboards with either just 4 keys, or 3 keys for games like osu!, osu!mania and Geometry Dash?  
The Rhythm Pad aims to be complatible with many rhythm games, such as the ones listed above.  
This should be compatible with VIA and should also be able to be used as a macropad.
